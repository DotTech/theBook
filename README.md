theBook
=======

This is the first crowd sourced book on Sitecore MVC. 
It is going to be entirely written using Markdown and hosted here on GitHub.

The idea was born on a Friday night after having searched for good resources online. As usual there are a lot of bits and pieces here and there, some of great quality, and this gave me the idea that we could focus the community energies into creating a great book about this topic.

If you like the idea, let's begin by putting together the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/SitecoreMVC/theBook/blob/master/table-of-content.md). This will work a bit like a wiki, but hopefully using Github and Markdown will facilitate things a bit.

My name is Francesco Gallarotti (@gallarotti) and I will be the host and administrator of the project. Contact me if you have ideas and/or suggestions. And please share this with all your colleagues and friends that could be interested in participating!
