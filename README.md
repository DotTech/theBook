# Sitecore MVC - the Book

This is the first crowdsourced book on Sitecore MVC. 
It is going to be entirely written using **Markdown** and hosted here on GitHub.

The idea was born on a Friday night, after having searched for good resources online. As usual, I found that there are a lot of bits and pieces of information here and there, some of great quality. This gave me the idea that, working together, the Sitecore community could create a great book about this topic.

If you like the idea, let's begin by putting together the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/SitecoreMVC/theBook/blob/master/table-of-content.md). This will work a bit like a *wiki*, but hopefully using Github and Markdown will facilitate things a bit.

My name is Francesco Gallarotti ([@gallarotti](https://www.twitter.com/gallarotti) on Twitter) and I will be the *project maintainer*. Please contact me if you have ideas and/or suggestions. And don't forget to share this project with all your colleagues and friends that could be interested in participating! 

Thank you!

## How to submit content

As clearly explained in one of the [Github Help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) pages, 

> the **fork & pull model** lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.

Therefore, submitting a **Pull Request** is going to be the best way to submit your content to the book.
