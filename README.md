#Sitecore MVC - the Book

This is the first crowdsourced book on Sitecore MVC. 
It is going to be entirely written using **Markdown** and hosted here on GitHub.

The idea was born on a Friday night, after having searched for good resources online. As usual, I found that there are a lot of bits and pieces of information here and there, some of great quality. This gave me the idea that, working together, the Sitecore community could create a great book about this topic.

If you like the idea, let's begin by putting together the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/SitecoreMVC/theBook/blob/master/table-of-content.md). This will work a bit like a *wiki*, but hopefully using Github and Markdown will facilitate things a bit.

My name is Francesco Gallarotti {{[@gallarotti](https://www.twitter.com/gallarotti) on Twitter}} and I will be the host and administrator of the project. Please contact me if you have ideas and/or suggestions. And don't forget to share this project with all your colleagues and friends that could be interested in participating! 

Thank you!
